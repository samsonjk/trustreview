# 🛒 Decentralized Product Review System

This project is a **Web3-based product review platform** that enables users to submit, view, and verify reviews on the blockchain. Built using **Next.js**, **Wagmi**, and **Alchemy SDK**, it ensures decentralized, tamper-proof product reviews while integrating wallet authentication. Users can connect their wallets, submit reviews with Ethereum transactions, and view sorted product reviews dynamically.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Decentralized Reviews** – Ensures transparency and authenticity by storing reviews on the blockchain.  
✅ **Wallet Authentication** – Users must connect a wallet to submit reviews.  
✅ **Review Sorting** – Displays reviews in descending order based on submission time.  
✅ **Prioritized Product Listings** – Products with reviews are displayed first.  
✅ **Real-Time Updates** – Automatically updates review lists without refreshing.  
✅ **Transaction Verification** – Each review is linked to **Etherscan** for on-chain proof.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi  
- **Blockchain Tools**: Alchemy SDK, Ethers.js  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (if applicable)
